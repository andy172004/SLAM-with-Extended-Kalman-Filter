EKF Mapping
Goal: Estimate the positions of landmarks when the robotâ€™s pose is known.

The robot explores the environment and observes unknown landmarks using range-bearing sensors.

Since the robot's pose is assumed to be accurately known, EKF is used to update estimates of the landmark locations only.

Useful as an intermediate step to understand how observations refine map accuracy.
