# SLAM-with-Extended-Kalman-Filter
This is the where you exactly want to be if you trying to learn  about SLAM and Kalman Filters. Everything is taken from basic and implemented in MATLAB. 
HAPPY LEARNING AHEAD!!!

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM** using MATLAB.  
It covers the full SLAM pipeline:
- EKF Localization (known landmarks)
- EKF Mapping (known robot pose)
- Full EKF SLAM (estimating both pose and map)

Before diving directly into the code I will directly recommend going through SLAM theory deeply.
Here is the link for you tube playlist I followed for theory: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGQrZ4O5QzbIHgl3b1JHimN_&feature=shared
Without theory everything will go above the head.

## üìå Features
- 2D simulation of robot and landmarks
- Motion and measurement updates
- Range and bearing-based observation model
- Visualization of robot path and estimated landmarks

## üß∞ Technologies
- MATLAB

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the `.m` files in MATLAB.
3. Run simulation files to begin simulation.

## üì∑ Output Preview
Here is the final output of EKF-SLAM
