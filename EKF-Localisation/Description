 EKF Localization
Goal: Estimate the robot’s position in a known environment (with known landmark/map positions).

The robot receives control inputs (like velocity, angular velocity) and noisy sensor measurements of known landmarks (range and bearing).

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) fuses motion predictions and sensor updates to estimate the robot’s pose (position + orientation) with reduced uncertainty.
