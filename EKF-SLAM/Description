EKF SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
Goal: Estimate both the robot’s pose and the positions of landmarks—simultaneously.

This is the most challenging scenario: both the robot’s location and the map are unknown and uncertain.

EKF SLAM builds a joint state vector that includes both the robot’s pose and landmark positions, and continuously updates both using motion and sensor data.

The filter maintains the correlations between robot and landmark uncertainties, which is key to accuracy.

Overall output of this file can be seen in EKF-SLAM.mp4 file.
